# Digipops Code Test

## Directions

1.  Create a web application that displays a list of films
2.  Users should be able to add new films and delete films (it is not required that a user be able to edit a film)
3.  Store all films in a `films` collection in Google Firestore
4.  Implement 2 Google Cloud Functions that run whenever a film is created or deleted. Both functions will do the same thing: calculate and store the total number of films that currently exist in the `films` collection
5.  Display the total in the UI.

You're welcome to use a frontend framework or none at all. Styling is not very important â€“ we're mostly concerned with code readability and succesful implementation of Google Firestore and Cloud Functions.

Good luck!
